## Business Understanding: 
The project intends to predict the accident severity for given road, weather, climate and other conditions among others. The dataset is taken from kaggle- UK roads safety: Traffic accidents and vehicles. 
## Data understanding:
The dataset contains 1.92 million records and 34 columns. Data cleaning and preprocessed the data. The data corresponding to slight severity is 84.84%, serious severity is 13.86% and for fatal severity is 1.30%. Several processing techniques as undersampling and oversampling were tried. Our main aim is to predict the serious and fatal severity with high precision and F1 score.

## Data Source:

## objective 
Predict accident severity at each output area (LSOA) given datetime and driving conditions For each Police Force we build a prediction model with the following objective.
Given date, time, weather, light and road conditions, predict accident severity within the operating geographic area of a police force
